# ðŸ“„ PDF Summarizer

## Description
This PDF Summarizer project aims to address the need for efficiently
summarizing PDF documents, making it easier for users to extract key
information from lengthy texts. The primary objectives of the project are to
develop a user-friendly interface for uploading PDF files, selecting specific
pages or ranges for summarization, generating summaries using advanced
natural language processing techniques, and enabling question-answering
functionality based on the content of the documents.

The system is built with the aim of summarising a PDF file uploaded by the user. This system was created using Streamlit, LangChain, and OpenAI frameworks.
